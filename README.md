# GR Dungeon 1

I made this game solo and did not use AI. 
All the assets are full colour, I made a custom shader in Unity ShaderGraph that renders everything in only 4 chosen colours. Real-time calculation. If the project is worth nothing else, that is Neato! Since I made this game in a week with no team and I am mainly a programmer, and did not want to use AI generated content, I used lots of human-made, free content for you to have nice things for you to look at and hear along with the functioning game play. All assets used in this game are either my lowly original work, or from the following high quality free content. The original artists would love you to click these links!

Note that most modern browsers require you to click one time within the game screen to allow it to play audio. This is not avoidable by me, nor would I. It's a security measure. If you don't want to click, you can play without sound by pressing only the W key, as long as that browser window/tab has focus.

Thanks for playing, hope you enjoy it!
